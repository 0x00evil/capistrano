#### Improvements Explained

##### #103 - Using non-master branch fails with Ruby 1.9

Suraj Kurapati discovered that under Ruby 1.0 when setting your branch name like this:

    set :branch, :some-branch-you-want-to-use

That there is a problem comparing the symbol provided against the string that the SCM module returns. This appears only to be a problem under Ruby 1.9, we have a cross-platform fix in the shape of a `.to_s` on the branch name where the comparison takes place.

The work around if you cannot upgrade to 2.5.9 is to specify the branch name as a string.

##### #96  - Tweak for 1.9 Compatibility

Here on [IsItRuby1.9](http://isitruby19.com/capistrano) we've had reports that Capistrano would work fine if we swapped a `retry` for a `redo`, there are [subtle differences](http://blog.commonthread.com/2007/12/15/tip-ruby-break-redo-next-and-retry) but we think it is acceptable to perform this way, and doesn't seem to cause any problems.

This bug would also have manifested under some circumstances for anyone capifying a new application with Ruby 1.9, this has also been fixed.

Regrettably without upgrading there is no workaround; save for rolling back to Ruby 1.8x.

##### #79  - Capistrano hangs on shell command for many computers

We apologise to anyone that has suffered at the hand of this bug; it really had us stumped, we were fortunate to meet Daniel Azuma who was working in isolation and came up with a fix, this has been applied to Net:SSH (see *Other News* for more info) and they have shipped a new release `2.0.14` which contains the fix. There are a selection of links with more info for those who're interested below, rest assured though that this is fixed.

If you do not want to upgrade Capistrano, **you can simply upgrade Net:SSH**, version `2.0.14` should be working now.

##### #77  - Copy command doesn't work on Solaris due to tar/gtar

Solaris 10 by default has a gtar command that provides the normal tar functionality, and the tar command works slightly differently. Thanks to Jeremy we have a patch, if you are affected you can specify which command to use now using

If you want to workaround this issue in previous releases of Capistrano, you can try:

    set :copy_compression, :zip

Net::SSH, the library upon which Capistrano is built is now being managed by Delano Mandelbaum, there is a bug tracker at http://net-ssh.lighthouseapp.com/ - for related issues, we still suggest using the Capistrano Google Groups mailing list; as many issues are cross-over and both communities can contribute; Delano is on the list, and
